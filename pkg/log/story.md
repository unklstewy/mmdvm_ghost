# Story: Port Logging

**Priority:** High

**Reference:** `Log.cpp`, `Log.h`

**Task:** Implement structured logging.

## Details
The logging system is responsible for structured and configurable logging throughout the application. This involves initializing and managing log files.

### Implementation Steps
1. Analyze the C++ implementation in `Log.cpp` and `Log.h`.
2. Port the logging logic to Go.
3. Write unit tests to validate the implementation.

### Example
```go
package log

func InitLogger() {
	// TODO: Initialize logger
}
```
